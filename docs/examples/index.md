# Examples

This is a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use the various features of the BioExperiment Suite. It will guide you through the process of using the API to perform common tasks in such order:

<!-- 1. Working with the [Pump](pump.md) and [Spectrophotometer](spectrophotometer.md) directly;
2. [Discover connected devices automatically](discover_devices.md);
3. Set up a [basic experiment](simple_experiment.md);
4. Set up a [more complex experiment](complex_experiment.md) with loops and file output;
5. [Use the BioExperiment Suite with a GUI](gui.md). -->
